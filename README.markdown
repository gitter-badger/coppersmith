**coppersmith** is a library to enable the joining, aggregation, and synthesis
of "features", streams of facts about entities derived from "analytical
records".

This library was originally written by a squad within the Analytics &
Information group at [Commonwealth Bank](https://www.commbank.com.au/), looking
to improve the task of authoring and maintaining features for use in predictive
analytics and machine learning.

Our working hypothesis was that for all the complexity of the business domain
and the size of the data sets involved, fundamentally the logic used in feature
generation can be described as simple functions and those functions should be
able to be composed. The framework now called **coppersmith** grew out of our
efforts to improve the lives of feature authors.

We have a richly detailed [user guide](USERGUIDE.markdown),
which we consider a good introduction to **coppersmith**. PR's to the user
guide as you become familiar with the library are especially encouraged!!!

There is also a [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.markdown) available.
